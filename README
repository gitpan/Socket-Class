Socket::Class - A class to communicate with sockets
===================================================

Socket::Class provides a simple, fast and efficient way to communicate with
sockets.
It operates outside of the PerlIO layer and can be used as a replacement
to IO::Socket.
Little parts of Bluetooth technology has been integrated. Please see below.

The standard build includes Bluetooth protocols for RFCOMM (stream) and
L2CAP (datagram). Bluetooth adapters on a MS-Windows operation system must be
compatible with the Windows Bluetooth API to get it working.
More specific Bluetooth support could be added in the future.

It has been tested on unix, darwin, MSWin(32,x64), cygwin, solaris, freebsd
and aix platforms.
